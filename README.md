## 📝 Description

For the course of statistics, we had to make a presentation about cross-validation. This presentation is made with the [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.

## 🚀 Usage

If you want just to run the presentation, you can use the following command:

```bash
sh Start.sh
```

If you want to run with the auto-reload feature, you can use the following command (you need to have the `entr` package installed):

```bash
